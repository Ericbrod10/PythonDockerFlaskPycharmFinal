# Project Description

## REST API with Flask, Docker, PyCharm, Postman and MySQL (Homework 4 - Final)

### Overview
In this project you will need to create a REST API and use Postman to test the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE request
methods. You will need to get my project to run on the assignment 4 branch, so you can see how everything
works and then create your own project with new data but having the exact same functionality.
